# Roadmap (post-1.0)

- Strings: char literals, escapes, indexing, slicing; minimal stdlib utilities.
- Control flow: condition-only `for` (desugar to `while`).
- Builtins: variadic `println` or string join helpers.
- Analyzer: stronger return-path checks, assignment compatibility diagnostics.
- Language: methods on structs; visibility; possibly modules.
- Tooling: CI with example smoke tests; release automation.
